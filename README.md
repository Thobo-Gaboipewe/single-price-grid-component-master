## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
li:nth-child(n) {
        margin-left: 7%;
    }

ul {
      padding-left: 0;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve on my front end design skills by leveraging available frameworks as well as focus more on back end development.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me with semantic css styling as well as the box model. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
